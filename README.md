# Resume

My overengineered [resume] pipeline built using [Typst][typst] and [Cloudflare R2][r2]. Content is
pulled from [`data.yml`](data.yml) and displayed based on the layouts in the [`layouts/`](layouts/)
directory. Upon a push to the default branch, all the layouts are automatically rendered and
uploaded to [R2][r2].

My most up-to-date resume can be found at [resumes.krantz.dev/default.pdf][default] or
[krantz.to/resume][shortlink].
